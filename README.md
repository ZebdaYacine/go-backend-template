# go-backend-template
This repository demonstrates a Go backend using a RESTful API. The server is built with the Gin framework and MongoDB as the database, but you can easily replace these tools to suit your needs.

The template follows a clean architecture pattern, which ensures the code is readable, testable, and maintainable.

Note: The repository is a work in progress, but you can start with the initial commit to build your own Go API using this open-source template.
